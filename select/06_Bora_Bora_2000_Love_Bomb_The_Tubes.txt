Hey, paradise island
[incomprehensible] 2000
Were are you from? [incomprehensible]
How many years? How many years?
Ten years time
Two thousand years, two million years, so
Bora Bora [incomprehensible] 2000
I'll be your lover
Come and discover a brave new world
Like Cupid's warrior
I will destroy your sorrow girl
Don't resist me
There ain't no love defense department
Once you kiss me
There'll be a meltdown of your heart
Lover, lover, you don't need another
Just duck and cover
We detonated and then we really made it
In the mist we faded
Kiss, kiss, boom, boom
Bang, zoom to the moon
Love bomb, you are the target
Love bomb, of my thermal romantic device
Love bomb, I aim to get you
Love bomb,  'cause I'm deadly but I’m so nice
Lover, lover, you don't need another
Just duck and cover
We detonated and then we really made it
In the mist we faded
Ten, nine, eight, seven
All good lovers go to heaven, bombs away
Six, five, four, three, two, one
How I learn to love the love bomb, Bora Bora
Kiss, kiss, boom, boom
Kiss, kiss, boom, boom
Kiss, kiss, boom, boom
Bang, zoom to the moon
Love bomb, I’ll be your lover
Love bomb, come and discover a brave new world
Love bomb, Like Cupid's warrior
Love bomb, I will destroy your sorrow, girl
Love bomb, early warning
Love bomb, you told me to strike before the dawn
Love bomb, atomic morning
Love bomb, D-Day has come for the love bomb
Lover, lover, you don't need another
Just duck and cover
We detonated and then we really made it
In the mist we faded
Ten, nine, eight, seven
All good lovers go to heaven, bombs away
Six, five, four, three, two, one
How I learn to love the love bomb
