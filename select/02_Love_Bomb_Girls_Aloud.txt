I a mambo, chico
Let's cha cha cha

Now it's time for you to shake your booty
Come let me see if you can move me
You're really looking kinda groovy
But can you handle 5-like cuties?
When we're chilling out in the place
With the treble and the happy bass
There is something gotta understand
We're in command with the mic in our hand

So if the music makes you dance
And the words make you sing
Let's talk the mambo
1, 2, 3
Cha Cha Cha

L O V E Love bomb
You blow my mind
L O V E Love bomb
You cha cha cha
L O V E Love bomb
You make me ch-ch-cha ch-ch-cha-cha ch-ch-cha

Cha cha cha
Ch-ch-cha ch-ch-cha-cha ch-ch-cha

Now let me see if you can flow
How do I know if you're good to go?
Yeah I'm the one who likes to control
Over the body and the mind and the soul
Watch me rock from the left to the right
Come let me see if you can rock all night
Baby you can call me
I'm feeling kinda horny

So if the music makes you dance
And the words make you sing
Let's talk the mambo
1, 2, 3
Cha Cha Cha
