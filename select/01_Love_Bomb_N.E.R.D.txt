Sitting Here in this white patterned room
Imagining I'm a meteor flying out through the distant space
How does tiny speckle earth destroy tomorrow
So capable of so many things
Why make life taking planes
I believe, that when you lose your root
Choose the sunlight
It could be your guide
No more political dreams
Not another excuse
Don't need another love song when you the love bomb
[Chorus:]
To just blow us away
To freakin' blow the lights out
Turning night to day
Hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now
Fuck what the government says
We gotta save some lights now
Is that OK?
Can't you see?
This is the Truman show baby
Cause when they fight who dies is you
Oh what if you unscrew me
We've got the same gears and same tools
But how you gonna catch up with your head hanging down
What'cha see staring at the ground
I believe, even without a clue
You've got sunlight
And it can be your guide
No more political dreams
Not another excuse
Don't need another love song when you the love bomb
[Chorus]
[Bridge:]
I'm trying to imply the few,
By removing propaganda but,
The must of fused a dove with super-glue,
I'm tryin' to take a machine apart yea,
What I'm simply trying to do
Is have the business take a pause,
I've been down every avenue,
But every body's good as gone
[Chorus]
