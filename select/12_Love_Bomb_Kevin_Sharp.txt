I met her on a Monday down at the blue star
Where we all hang out
I picked her up at work Tuesday afternoon
That night we were rockin' the town
Wednesday, Thursday-- time sure flies when you're havin' a ball
A perfect match no strings attached
By Friday we'd done it all
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin' and a kissin' in the back of her car
I said ain't this the life, what could go wrong
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
Those three little words
Set off a chain reaction like I'd never seen
I was shakin' in my boots
When she lit the fuse I was blown to smithereens
5, 4, 3, 2, 1- it hit me like a ton of bricks
She's got a mind to cross that line
I shoulda known it would come to this
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin' and a kissin' in the back of her car
I said ain't this the life, what could go wrong
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
I was keeping it loose, taking it slow
Playing it cool, but wouldn't you know
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin' and a kissin' in the back of her car
I said ain't this the life, what could go wrong
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
